## Cloud Concepts

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing, database storage, applications, and other IT resources over the Internet.

### History of Cloud Computing:
1. Mainframe Computing (1950s): Central computer accessed by numerous user devices (dumb terminals).
2. Virtual Machines (1970s): Multiple complete operating systems on a single piece of hardware.
3. Hypervisor (Not elaborated in the notes).

### Cloud Computing in Daily Life:
Examples include email services, streaming platforms, outlook.com, and cloud.

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.
3. Stop guessing about capacity.
4. Increase speed and agility.
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
6. Go global in minutes.

### Three Main Cloud Computing Models:
1. SaaS (Software as a Service): Managed by the service provider, easy to use, least flexibility (e.g., Gmail).
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service): Deploy and manage applications without worrying about underlying hardware infrastructure. Less flexible than IaaS (e.g., Microsoft Azure Web Hosting, Heroku, Google App Engine).
3. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Basic building blocks, most flexibility and management control, closest to traditional on-premises data centers (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services).

### Cloud Deployment Models:
1. Cloud Deployment: 100% of IT infrastructure on the cloud, removes roadblocks of costly procurement process.
2. On-Premises Deployment: Uses virtualization in on-premises data centers, security-focused, not much benefit to cloud computing.
3. Hybrid Deployment: Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources, suitable for companies in the process of migrating to the cloud.

### Choosing the Deployment Model:
1. Cloud Deployment: For organizations with few deployed IT resources, seeking flexibility and affordability.
2. On-Premises Deployment: For data that must be secured on-premises.
3. Hybrid Deployment: For companies with legacy IT resources, providing quick access to on-premises resources with cloud backup.

### Well-Architected Framework:
1. Avoid unnecessary costs.
2. Reliability: Test disaster recovery settings, incorporate redundancy.
3. Efficiency.
4. Security: Protect information, system, and assets, enable traceability, manage access.
5. Operational Excellence: Document, refine procedures, anticipate failure, learn from failure.
6. Sustainability: Focus on achieving maximum benefit from provisioned resources to minimize environmental impact.
